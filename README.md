## Documented Development Workflow (DDW)

The Documented Development Workflow (DDW) is a method designed to help beginner coders learn effectively by documenting each step of the development process. This approach aims to prevent beginners from getting stuck in a cycle of following tutorials without understanding how to apply their knowledge independently. By using DDW, you will:

- Document your thought process and decisions.
- Keep track of dependencies and tools used.
- Create a to-do list with detailed steps and research findings.
- Develop a project incrementally, reflecting on and learning from each step.

For more detailed documentation, please refer to the [Documented Development Workflow (DDW) file](docs/DDW.md).
